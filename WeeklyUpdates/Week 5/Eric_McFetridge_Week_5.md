1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
	
	This week I spent roughly 6 hours working on, or discussing the project with my teammates. 	

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**

    | Rank | Activity | Hours Spent |
    | :--- | :----: | ---: |
    | 1 | Research | 4 |
    | 2 | Meetings | 1 |
    | 3 | Documentation | 1 |


3. **What did you accomplish this week?**

  This week we finalized out project hardware requirements for the components ordering form. This involved a fair amount of research as I am responsible for the motor control subsystem of our project. I found motors and drivers that are ideal for our design plans. We know have a platform to start prototyping on once our components arrive. I also started modelling the software design patter for the motor controls, and determining how we will supply both data and power. 
  
4. **How do you feel about your progress?**
  
	I feel that we are still progressing at a consistent rate. Our proposal was succesful, and we have a solid ground plan for each person to work on their components.  

5. **What are you planning to do next week?**

	Next week I plan to start designing the motor hardware housing. This will be the glue that holds all of our components together, ideally allowing all 4 Pis to slide in and out for maitnence. We will need a sturdy (probably wooden) base so the motors do not out-torque the weight of the system and shift the housing. I plan to start initial CAD designs, and to further document the motors hardware-software interface.  

6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
 	
   Team has been communicating fairly well. We could improve our response times, but in all nothing is preventing progress.
