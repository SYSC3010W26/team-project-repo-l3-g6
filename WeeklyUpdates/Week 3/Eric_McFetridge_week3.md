1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
	
	This week I spent roughly 8 hours working on, or discussing the project with my teammates. 	

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**

| Rank | Activity | Hours Spent |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| 1 | Documentation | 2.5 |
| 2 | Research | 2.5 |
| 3 | Meetings | 2 |
| 4 | Design | 1 |


3. **What did you accomplish this week?**

	This week I accomplished some core foundational tasks that will help us going forward. I set up a cloud based project planner that allows everyone on the team to assign tasks, and track their progress on those tasks on a timeline.

	The end dates in the tasks align with the project deliverable dates to ensure we are always ready for the next deadline. This isn’t limited to just tasks, we also schedule meetings, research sessions, and more here. This gives us a fully clear edit history where the entire project is back-traceable like in a professional environment. 
	
	We also did research regarding existing technology in the field, and how we can not just re-invent the wheel. We looked into hardware options, and how our hardware requirements align with our given budget.
	
	Due to our project planner all of our research and rough notes are shared in a live updating dashboard. We can easily keep track of meeting minutes, and research since we have organizational folders for different categories of document. 
	
	I also did some informal design work this week. I made crude UI and hardware enclosure mockups to get a better understanding of our desired product UX and branding/theme. We discussed what should be handled by software, vs what would be improved by being a dedicated hardware module.


4. **How do you feel about your progress?**
  
  I feel that we made very good progress this week in regards to organizational and housekeeping tasks. We also now have a much more clear definition of our project scope and requirements to start doing more specific research.
 
  We were able to divide responsibilities among the group and have gotten over the initial hurdle of setting up a clear communication channel. We have chosen microsoft teams as our platform for messaging, and a combination of notion for documentation, and github for software as a project management platform.

  This gives us clear commit and editing histories for all project related files. So nobody is ever out of the loop about what their teammate has been working on. This means everyones responsibilities are clearly defined ahead of time, so nobody can ever say they “didn’t know” they had to do a specific task, since it would be assigned to them with a clear deadline. 


5. **What are you planning to do next week?**

  Next week we plan to enter more heavily into the research phase now that we have defined our project. Performing in-depth research is invaluable to avoiding bugs in the testing, development, and deployment phases.
	
  Once we have completed our base research, we will require real hardware specifications, to determine which parts we can use. We are moving from: what should the hardware do? To: what should the hardware actually be? And how does this align with our budget and timeline? 

  The same objective will be started for software. It is easy for us to say “The Pi will communicate with the logs database via a local http connection to an API.” However, we need to decide what frameworks, database schema, security, middleware, and other important implementation related information is relevant to our project.

  All of the above stems from the need to perform further research and documentation, since we are not concerned with actually implementing hardware or software until our plan is thorough.   


6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
 	
	Now that our group has defined responsibilities and have set up a collaborative platform for messaging and documentation, I feel that we have cleared any roadblocks that might have been holding us back. We are able to meet both in-person and online so we can work around eachothers busy schedules.
