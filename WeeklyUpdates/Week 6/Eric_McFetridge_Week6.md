1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
	
	This week I spent roughly 3 hours working on, or discussing the project with my teammates. 	

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**

    | Rank | Activity | Hours Spent |
    | :--- | :----: | ---: |
    | 1 | Design | 3 |

3. **What did you accomplish this week?**

  This week I was able to create a few 3D models to begin planning the hardware phase of our project. I was able to identify some early hardware design choices that must be made from these models. Our team did not meet as we were all busy with our other courses, but we still communicated over teams.
  
4. **How do you feel about your progress?**
  
	This week we made less progress than others, but we are still progressing well overall.   

5. **What are you planning to do next week?**

	Next week I hope to further refine my 3D models to make the first prototype of the housing 3D print ready. I also hope to decide with my team the software implementation of how my actuator Pi will receive commands from the server pi.    

6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
 	
   No, we plan to meet during the reading week break.
