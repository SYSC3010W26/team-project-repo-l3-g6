1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
	
	This week I spent roughly 6 hours working on, or discussing the project with my teammates. 	

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:**

    | Rank | Activity | Hours Spent |
    | :--- | :----: | ---: |
    | 1 | Proposal | 2 |
    | 2 | Design | 2 |
    | 3 | Research | 1 |
    | 4 | Meetings | 1 |


3. **What did you accomplish this week?**

	This week we accomplished both our rough and final proposal drafts. We also peer reviewed others propsals, and completed lab 4. In regards to the project I worked on research for my components, and made many different UML diagrams representing the different use cases and workflows of our project. The majority of time this week was spent working on the proposal, and we now have a much more clear hardware and software definition for our system. 

4. **How do you feel about your progress?**
  
	I feel that we are progressing at a steady, but consistent rate. We are not ahead of schedule, but we are not falling behind. Our proposal was split evenly among the group members and we were able to take some good pointers from the feedback we receieved from our peers. 

5. **What are you planning to do next week?**

	Next week I plan to get the exact hardware specifications required for our project in order for us to complete the upcoming componenents ordering form, and to finalize the budget for our project. I also plan to start making 3D renders and models to determine how our project should look when assembled. 

6. **Is anything blocking you that you need from others?**
 	
	No, sometimes our schedules make it hard to meet, but we are able to communicate via teams.
