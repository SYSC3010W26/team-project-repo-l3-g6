1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
   5 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:\***

- Writing/Documenting: 3 hours (Working on the proposal drafts and peer reviews)
- Research/Evaluating Options: 2 hours (Looking into specific components for my assigned role)
- Meetings: 1 hour (Syncing up on the final proposal and lab tasks)

3. **_What did you accomplish this week?_** _(Be specific)_

- Completed my assigned sections for both the rough and final versions of the project proposal.
  Participated in the peer review process for other groups' proposals and finished the requirements for Lab 4.
- Researched specific hardware components to make sure they actually fit the software logic we’re planning.
- Helped finalize the system's workflow so we have a clear idea of how the hardware and software will talk to each other.

4. **_How do you feel about your progress?_** _(brief, free-form reflection)_

- Thankfully, we’ve found a rhythm that works for us. The communication is way better now, and it feels good to finally have a solid grasp on the design and where we’re actually heading

5. **_What are you planning to do next week_**? _(give specific goals)_

- Start looking into the specific libraries or API documentation I’ll need for the implementation phase.
- Database (DB) Structure: Map out the schema and tables to determine exactly how we’re storing and retrieving project data.
- GUI Design: Create initial wireframes or mockups for the user interface to ensure it’s intuitive and functional.

6. **_Is anything blocking you that you need from others?_** _(What do you need from whom)_

- group availability is an issue for now , but we are making up for it through constant communication through teams
